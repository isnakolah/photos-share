# photos-share

A fork of [Immich Public Proxy](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy) that lets friends **add** photos to a shared Immich album, not just view them.

What it adds on top of upstream:

- **Guest uploads**: an "Add your photos" button on album links that have *Allow upload* turned on in Immich. Uploads use tus with 50 MB chunks, so large videos get past Cloudflare Tunnel's 100 MB request limit and resume after dropped connections.
- **Attribution**: guests enter their name once. Every photo is marked "Added by <name>" in Immich (description plus an `uploader/<name>` tag) and on the share page, which also has a filter by person.
- **Upload log and admin page**: a SQLite log of who uploaded what, when, and from where. A LAN-only admin page can move everything one person uploaded to Immich's trash.
- **Share sheet and QR code** on every album page.

Deployment for nomonhomelab lives in [`deploy/`](deploy/): an Immich stack plus this proxy, published at `photos.nomonlab.com` via cf-dns. Pushes to `main` are tested on GitHub and deployed by a self-hosted runner.

Upload-related environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `IMMICH_API_KEY` | Album owner's API key. Guest uploads stay off until this is set. |
| `OWNER_NAME` | Name shown on photos you added yourself |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | Per-file limit (default 10 GiB) |
| `UPLOAD_TMP_DIR` / `UPLOAD_DB_PATH` | Chunk storage and SQLite log (default `/data/...`) |
| `ADMIN_PORT` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin page listener (default 3001, `0` disables) and its basic-auth password |
| `IMMICH_PUBLIC_URL` | Base URL for "open in Immich" links on the admin page |

Licensed AGPL-3.0 like upstream. This repository is the source for the running service.

Share your Immich photos and albums in a safe way without exposing your Immich instance to the public.

👉 See a [Live demo gallery](https://demo.ipp.nz/s/demo-gallery)
serving straight out of my own Immich instance.

Setup takes less than a minute, and you never need to touch it again as all of your sharing stays managed within Immich.

## About this project

[Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) is a wonderful bit of software, but since it holds all your private photos it's
best to keep it fully locked down. This presents a problem when you want to share a photo or a gallery with someone.

**Immich Public Proxy** provides a barrier of security between the public and Immich, and _only_ allows through requests
which you have publicly shared. It is stateless, needs no API key, and knows nothing about your Immich instance beyond
what you have shared.

Read more in the [Introduction](https://docs.ipp.nz/introduction), including
[why not just expose Immich's `/share/` path](https://docs.ipp.nz/introduction#why-not-expose-immich-directly).

## Quick start

1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.
2. Set `IMMICH_URL` to the local (not public) URL of your Immich server, and `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the public URL of IPP.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` and check that `https://your-proxy-url.com/share/healthcheck` responds.
4. In Immich's **Server Settings**, set the "External domain" to your IPP URL. Every link Immich generates from now on
   points at the proxy.

If you use Cloudflare, set your `/share/video/*` path to Bypass Cache or videos may not play.

## Feature requests

You can [add feature requests here](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Feature+Requests%22+sort%3Atop),
however my goal with this project is to keep it as lean as possible.

IPP has **read-only** access to Immich and stores nothing: anything that needs an API key, modifies Immich, or would
require storing a share key won't be considered. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full list.
